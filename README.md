The City of The Damned - Apocalypse is a 2011 PWAD made by Tormentor667 as a sequel to his another Wad, The City of The Damned, althrough loosely connected to it.

The mod takes place during 1920's. A cult known as Darkmoon decides to unleash a demon named Thamuz and hordes of other hellish creatures on a small city. A siren was installed to inform citizens about especially malicious monsters that come out when it sounds, and a shelter is only way to escape them.
